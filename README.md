The minimum supported Android version is 5.0.

## Door Status

The door status is determined based on the text returned of the HTTPS query or SSH command. Recognized are the keywords `LOCKED` (door closed) and `UNLOCKED` (door open) that can occure anywhere in the response, even in tags. If neither keyword is found, the door status is set to unknown. The complete return message is always displayed in the App for a short time (with HTML elements stripped).

## Auto-Select By SSID

The door setup can be selected depending on what WiFi network the device is connected to. This can help to avoid to switch the door setup by hand. Even multiple SSIDs can be set as a comma separated list.

## Build from Sources

On Linux based systems:

```
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
