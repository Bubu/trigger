(https setup, ssh setup, ssh key pair management)

Any help, bugfixes, new features, translations are much welcome.

## Download

[<img src="fdroid.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="90">](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.example.trigger/)

Alternatively, you can download packages (apk) in the [release](https://github.com/mwarning/trigger/releases) section.

The minimum supported Android version is 5.0.

## Usage

The status of the door is determined if the https query or ssh command returns the strings `LOCKED` (door closed), `UNLOCKED` (door open) or some other output (unknown door state). The return message is displayed in the App for a short period.

## Status

- HTTPS/SSH calls work.
- Sending the ssh public key as a registration mechanism is missing.
- The ssh key pair and certificate cannot be explicitly removed right now (but replaced).

## Build from Sources

On Linux based systems:

```
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
