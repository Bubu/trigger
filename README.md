## Door Status

The door status is determined based on the text returned of the HTTPS query or SSH command. Recognized are the keywords `LOCKED` (door closed) and `UNLOCKED` (door open). If neither keyword is recognized, the door status is set to unknown. The complete return message is displayed in the App for a short time.
